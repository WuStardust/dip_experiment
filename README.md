# Experiments for the Course of Digit Image Processing

## Exp 1
#### Aims: Use region growing algorithm to split out the biggest two circles in the source image. 
#### How to Run the Code:
* Open the MATLAB, and change the work diractory to the root path of this code
* Run `./twoCircle.m` without any parameters. Be sure that the source image `twoCircle.bmp` exits in `./src`
* Wait till the figure appears on the screen, select two point on the image, one in each circle, then press enter and wait
* The result will show on the screen. The white space is where those two circles lies. 

## Exp 2
#### Aims: Image restoration for motion blur
#### How to Run the Code
* Open the MATLAB, and change the work diractory to the root path of this code
* Run `./motionBlur.m` without any parameters. Be sure that the source image `motionBlur.bmp` exits in `./src`
* The result will show on the screen.
