#### Aims: Use region growing algorithm to split out the biggest two circles in the source image. 
#### How to Run the Code:
* Open the MATLAB, and change the work diractory to the root path of this code
* Run this program without any parameters. Be sure that the source image `twoCircle.bmp` exits in `./src`
* Wait till the figure appears on the screen, select two point on the image, one in each circle, then press enter and wait
* The result will show on the screen and will be saved to `./result/twoCircle.bmp`
